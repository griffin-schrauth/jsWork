Small js projs to help myself


1st proj is a tic-tac-toe using js,html,css. Needs to be updated. After a player wins, a the next player can still click on an an available space. Need to lock the screen after a player is deemed a winner. Followed a youtube video to practice.

connect4 is utilizing what i learned and using different methods to develop the game. 

Connect4 is finished. Turned the boxes into one long array. Had trouble figuring out how to check each box with out going out of scope. Ended up using multiple for loops which is not very optimal. New to js so not too upset with how it came out. I would have like to use a matrix (list of lists in python) and just maybe use a BFS to find a winner since the search tree wont be too big considering this is a 6 by 7 box.
